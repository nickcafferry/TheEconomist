DEALMAKERS ARE smooth talkers. They need to be. But which branch of finance has the slickest ones? Consider the polished, public-school manner of the City investment banker—or the high-velocity spiel of the Wall Street bank boss. Both have a strong claim. But the venture capitalists, or VCs, of Silicon Valley have a stronger one. They spend their time either being pitched to by, or pitching on behalf of, entrepreneurs who hope to be the next Zuck or Larry-and-Sergey. Peddlers of such extravagant dreams have to have silver tongues. 
They certainly have some catchy phrases. They speak of “vanity metrics” (misleading measures of a startup’s progress); of the importance of “product-market fit” (how well a piece of software meets the customer’s needs); and “deal heat”, the fever that causes investors to overpay. After a while even a normally buttoned-up Buttonwood is asking to “double-click” on a topic when he wants more detail from a voluble VC. 
A subject guaranteed to get them talking is the flood of capital into Silicon Valley. In the popular metaphor, the VC business used to consist of a flotilla of small boats fishing in a well-stocked lake. It was all very collegial. Now the lake is an ocean. Trawlers are out there—big institutions, such as sovereign-wealth funds and pension-fund managers, that increasingly invest directly in technology firms before they reach public markets. The abundance of capital has made the VC game more competitive. It has also distorted the market for privately held firms. 
That new firms are staying private for longer is both a cause and a consequence of this change. The deeper reasons for the shift are debated. Some VC types put it all down to regulations that made it costlier to become a public company and easier to remain a private one. Others place more weight on the changing nature of new firms, which need less capital than they once did, both to start and to grow. The building blocks for business software or smartphone apps are freely available as open-source code. Computing power can be leased. The result is a shift in the balance of power from suppliers of capital towards entrepreneurs, who want to be spared the scrutiny of public markets. 
Perhaps a more important shift than the fall in demand for capital has been a steady rise in its supply. The secular slump in long-term interest rates, caused in part by abundant savings, was given an extra shove after the financial crisis by central banks’ easy-money policies. Yields on listed stocks have fallen, too. The venturesome, noting the boom in the share prices of tech stocks, moved into pre-IPO financing in search of higher returns. Sums that not so long ago could only be raised through a stock-exchange listing are now routinely raised privately. 
One consequence has been a fall in the number of listed companies. By the time a tech startup goes public, its days of supercharged revenue growth may be over. This fear only fuels desperation to get in on the act sooner. There is much shaking of VC heads about the participation of institutions based back East in even the early funding rounds for new tech firms. VCs pride themselves on pastoral care: the support, expertise and contacts they provide to fledgling firms. What do “tourists” from Boston and New York bring, apart from their big cheques? 
As more and more money crams into Silicon Valley, valuations inevitably become inflated. Last month WeWork, an office-sharing firm, was forced to pull its IPO when public investors balked at the price tag. A bail-out by SoftBank, WeWork’s main backer and a writer of big cheques more generally, valued the firm at $8bn. Yet a funding round in January put the firm’s value at $47bn. “The damage done by SoftBank is incalculable,” says one Silicon Valley bigwig. “If you make a firm go faster, it does unnatural things.” There is a growing sense that capital is being wasted. “Businesses that shouldn’t be funded are getting funded,” says another VC. Sales and marketing budgets are swollen. Firms lose track of whether their product is any good. 
Nevertheless a general view is that it will take something dramatic—a meltdown in tech stocks or a sharp rise in interest rates—to scare the money from Silicon Valley. Big dreams are part of venture capitalism. Everyone fishing in these crowded waters still hopes to land a whale. Look at it another way, says a VC. In 2012 Facebook paid $1bn for Instagram, a firm that had 13 employees and was not yet two years old. That seemed profligate, he says. But with the benefit of hindsight, Facebook underpaid.
