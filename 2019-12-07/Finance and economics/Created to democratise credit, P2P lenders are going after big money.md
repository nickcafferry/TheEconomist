“GET YOUR money right,” says a giant billboard in garish, Instagram-friendly colours in San Francisco’s downtown. It is part of a campaign by SoFi, a fintech firm, to position itself as a one-stop shop for alternative finance. Founded in 2011 to cut the cost of student loans by enabling alumni to sponsor undergraduates, last year SoFi spent over $200m courting shoppers, homebuyers and young parents. It now collects funding from a wide variety of investors, including big institutions. 
The vision behind peer-to-peer (P2P) lending—allowing one ordinary person with spare cash to help another with a decent plan for spending it—was always a romantic one. Today only a few die-hards like RateSetter, a decade-old British lender, still hew to it; the rest, like SoFi, have diversified. New rules in Britain are the first salvo in a regulatory effort that will bring greater scrutiny. The bets P2P firms have made as they have grown will make or break them. 
Zopa was the first P2P lender, in Britain in 2005, closely followed by Prosper and LendingClub in America. The industry took off after the financial crisis of 2008, when consumers lost confidence in banks and started to move their lives online. The idea was that lower costs and less red tape would enable firms to serve clients whom banks shunned. 
The retail investors who provided funding could hope for annual returns of 4% or more. The firms would avoid credit risk while making money from transaction fees, and any late fees. Between 2013 and 2015 the stock of P2P loans grew fourfold in Britain, to £2.6bn ($3.4bn), and ninefold in the Americas, to $29bn. 
But further growth proved elusive. One reason was the high cost of acquiring customers. Platforms do not know how creditworthy someone who clicks on a Facebook or Google ad is, says Scott Sanborn of LendingClub. “[But] I have to pay for that click regardless.” At first they allowed investors to price loans—but gave them limited information about borrowers with which to do it. Investors thus asked for higher interest rates across the board, resulting in adverse selection. 
Banks can draw on cheap and plentiful deposits, whereas platforms had to compete for savings held by retail investors. That required a lot of hand-holding, says Neil Rimer of Index Ventures, a venture-capital firm. So from the mid-2010s P2P lenders turned to family offices, and pension and sovereign-wealth funds. They started to securitise loans, bundling hundreds of tiny amounts and selling them together. In 2017 institutional investors snapped up $13bn worth of securitised P2P loans. Last year they funded 90% of Prosper’s new loans, 94% of LendingClub’s and 64% of those of Funding Circle, a British firm that lends to small businesses. 
To cut acquisition costs, many platforms now cross-sell several types of loans. Zopa, which obtained a banking licence last December, offers car finance and wedding loans. LendingClub backs small businesses and refinances credit-card debt. Some also “white-label” their products, originating loans for traditional banks while remaining invisible to the public. 
The shift from pure P2P has earned these firms a new moniker: marketplace lenders (MPL). Last year they issued $50bn of loans in America, a tiny but growing slice of the stock of consumer credit ($4trn in 2018). PwC, a consultancy, reckons that figure will hit $1trn by 2030. Large MPLs, including LendingClub and Funding Circle, have gone public. Zopa is rumoured to be planning to follow. 
MPLs are now well-positioned for rapid growth, boosters say. Yet that vision is rosy. Born in an era of lax rules and economic expansion, the sector has never been truly tested. That is about to change. 
The first challenge is new competition. Fintech startups such as Affirm and Afterpay now provide instalment loans to shoppers at checkout. Payment firms such as PayPal and Square have started lending to small businesses. Amazon sponsors sellers on its marketplace; Uber will soon fund its drivers. Meanwhile banks are snapping up fintechs and investing in software. 
Second is a slowing economy. To make more money MPLs need to issue more loans. Since they do not take a hit from defaults, they have a bias towards accepting risky borrowers. That bias is worsened by reliance on institutional investors, who demand higher returns than retail investors, says Rhydian Lewis of RateSetter. A downturn could see defaults spike—and investors flee. Default rates are already rising at platforms that make them public. 
That is drawing regulatory attention—the industry’s third challenge. Britain is getting tougher on disclosure, governance and wind-down arrangements. From December 9th firms will be allowed to market themselves only to sophisticated investors. Some are preparing by running stress tests; others by creating “provision funds” that will make lenders whole if borrowers default. But rising compliance costs have pushed some smaller ones out of business. Further consolidation is due, insiders say. 
The winners may emerge stronger. For now, however, P2P backers are cautious. LendingClub, which was valued at $5.4bn when it listed in 2014, now has a market capitalisation of just $1.1bn. Funding Circle, which listed 15 months ago at a valuation of £1.5bn, is worth £346m. SoFi’s $4.3bn valuation has not budged since its 2017 funding round. “At first platforms were valued like tech companies,” says Aditya Khurjekar of Medici, a data firm. “But fintech is harder, much harder.” ■
