THE FALL of the Berlin Wall in 1989 supposedly consigned socialism to history. Now, after a decade of slow growth in living standards, and amid widespread belief that inequality is soaring, the radical left is back. “Millennial socialists”, as The Economist described them earlier this year, are fizzing with ideas. They soon hope to put them into practice—whether under President Bernie Sanders or Prime Minister Jeremy Corbyn, whose Labour Party aims to triumph in Britain’s general election on December 12th. A wave of new books shows what millennial socialists really want, and how they plan to get it. 
Socialists from Karl Marx onwards have deployed both ethical and empirical arguments to buttress their system. In “The Socialist Manifesto” Bhaskar Sunkara of Jacobin, a radical magazine, proceeds from first principles, maintaining that “to be a socialist is to assert the moral worth of every person, no matter who they are, where they’re from, or what they did”. By contrast, in “The 99 Percent Economy” Paul Adler of the University of Southern California sprays statistics to prove that modern capitalism is broken and socialism is the fix. 
Many readers will find both approaches unconvincing. A dyed-in-the-wool libertarian might use Mr Sunkara’s nostrum as a justification for an individualist worldview instead. Mr Adler’s methodology feels sketchy. Can all the problems he identifies, from stress to racism to underpaid teachers, truly be attributed to the capitalist mode of production? Fortunately, however, both books are better at explaining what 21st-century socialism might look like. 
Fortunately, because millennial socialists’ objectives are often misunderstood. One common mistake is to assume that they want to build a society in the image of social democracies such as the Nordic states, where progressive taxation of lightly regulated markets funds high-quality public services. But Messrs Sunkara and Adler insist they are no social democrats. Rather, they are democratic socialists. 
That may sound like a meaningless factional distinction. In fact it points to an entirely different system of economic management. Thomas Piketty explores the contrast in his polemical new book, “Capital and Ideology” (currently only available in French). Though everyone on the left sees social democracy as an improvement on red-blooded capitalism, it nonetheless struggles to break free from what Mr Piketty calls “proprietarianism”, defined as “the political ideology founded on the absolute respect for private property”. 
Since, under social democracy, true power continues to reside with the capitalists, its commitment to egalitarianism is necessarily fragile. A social-democratic government might tax the rich a bit more and redistribute the proceeds to the poor, which is all well and good. But such reforms are easy to undo. Look at the ease with which the Conservative government elected in Britain in 2010 reversed New Labour’s munificence in the previous decade. 
And the tools which social democrats typically use to advance their goals are ill-suited to the modern economy, as Branko Milanovic, a left-leaning scholar formerly at the World Bank, convincingly argues in “Capitalism, Alone”. Heavy industry, the traditional base for trade unions, has shrunk, making it hard to resuscitate organised labour. Meanwhile, “further mass expansion of education is impossible when a country has reached 14 or 15 years of education on average”. 
According to the millennial socialists, more radical changes are required. Collectively, their manifesto boils down to three big ideas. First, they want vastly more government spending to provide, among other things, free universal health care, a much more generous social safety-net and a “Green New Deal” to slash carbon-dioxide emissions. Second, many argue for looser monetary policy, to reduce the cost of funding these plans. 
The third plank of their thinking is the most radical. The underlying idea is that capitalism does not just produce poverty and inequality (though it does), but that, by forcing people to compete with each other, it also robs them of dignity and freedom. “The power imbalances are obvious when you enter into your employment contract,” says Mr Sunkara. For Mr Adler, capitalism “has sucked the life out of democracy”. 
Millennial socialists, therefore, support the “democratisation” of the economy (or socialisme participatif, as Mr Piketty puts it), whereby ordinary people play a greater role in the production process, the market is removed from as many aspects of everyday life as possible, and the influence of the rich is drastically curtailed. Such reforms, they argue, will create happier and more empowered citizens. 
What does “democratisation” mean in concrete terms? Some millennial socialists say everyone should be guaranteed a job; others want a universal basic income, a drastic reduction in the working week, or both. It also means promoting non-traditional forms of business organisation, including co-operatives, which give workers a decisive role in the day-to-day management of their company. 
Mr Adler thinks through how such plans would function. Drawing on his expertise in management, he explains in detail how firms could be managed along socialist lines. This practical bent also characterises a new book by Christine Berry and Joe Guinan, two researchers close to Britain’s Labour Party. In “People Get Ready!” they explain what may be required if a socialist Labour government is to succeed—from imposing capital controls to activists keeping up the pressure on elected politicians if they go soft. 
In a few short years socialists have gone from political and intellectual irrelevance to sketching out plans for government. One big question they face, however, is whether ordinary people have the stomach for the kind of change they envisage. Ms Berry and Mr Guinan appear to accept that a future Labour government’s fight with international finance might turn Britain into what they call a “siege economy”. This is “not particularly desirable as a long-term solution”, they concede; most Britons might object more bluntly. Mr Piketty’s proposed wealth tax of up to 90% would play havoc with incentives to invest, while under Mr Adler’s vision the “entire apparatus of the stock and bond market will disappear”—though, happily, “your phone will be yours to keep or to trade.” 
Mr Milanovic sympathises with the socialists’ yearning for radical change. But ultimately he finds many of their prescriptions unconvincing. A country which tried to de-marketise on the scale envisaged by the millennial socialists would, he says, be unstable and dissatisfied in other ways. Shifting towards a much shorter working week, for instance, would surely leave it poorer than its neighbours—and for how long would people put up with that? Capitalism is far from perfect, his book shows, yet after the fall of the Berlin Wall it is hard to shake the notion that it is the only system that broadly works. The millennial socialists are on the up, but they may still struggle to prove him wrong. ■
